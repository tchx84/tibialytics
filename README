Tibialytics is a community analyzer for CipSoft's MMORPG game Tibia. It
generates a guild ranking for any game world. To generate this ranking
it crawls through the game website, gathering all publicly available data
about the gameworld's guilds and players.

The ranking generator does an pseudo-statistical analysis that takes into
account: (a) player's basic data (levels), (b) pvp records, extracted from
player's public data and (c) social interaction records (marriage, fight's
assistance).

Usage by example:

1) $ruby run.rb Amera
2) $cd ./results/Amera/
3) Results are provided in two formats:
  a) geek friendly, verbose, plain text.
  b) human friendly, html sortable tables.

Dependencies:

1) Ruby
